Advantages of Python --> Python is Simple
                         Free and open source
                         Multi Program language
                         General Purpose Language
                         Platform independent

Disadvantage of Python -->Disadvantag 1. Python is slow as compared to c, c++, java etc
                                        due to python is compiled oriented language --> code -> compiler -> .pyc -> interpreter -> .exe it is executable file

                                        2. Python evaluates type of data at runtime 

                                        3. Garbage collection happens at runtime for efficient memory management
                        
                        Disadvantage 2. Not a good language for mobile development

                        Disadvantage 3. Python uses more memory than other languages
                                        Due to memory management always working in runtime and many other programs that run continuously
                                        takes memory for these program

                        Disadvantage 4. There are some limitations of PDBC in front of ODBC  and JDBC

                        Disadvantage 5. Lots of Runtime errors (as dynamically typed), Hence application requires more testing

                        Disadvatage 6. Python's Simplicity , moving to another language like c++, java is difficult
