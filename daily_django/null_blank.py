'''In Django, "null" and "blank" are attributes that can be set on model fields to control how they handle empty values:

null:

This attribute is used at the database level and determines whether a field in the database can store NULL values (i.e., no value).
If null=True is set on a model field, it means the database will allow this field to be empty (NULL).
If null=False (the default), the field will require a value in the database and Django will enforce this at the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) level.
blank:

This attribute is used for form validation within Django and specifies whether a field is allowed to be empty in forms.
If blank=True is set on a model field, Django's forms will allow an empty value for that field.
If blank=False (the default), Django's forms will require a value to be provided for that field.
Here's a quick summary:

null=True: Allows NULL values at the database level.
null=False (default): Requires a value at the database level.
blank=True: Allows empty values in Django forms.
blank=False (default): Requires a value in Django forms.
These attributes are particularly useful for defining how your data behaves at both the database and application levels, ensuring consistency and validation throughout your Django project.'''
