# In Django, a ManyTo-Many relationship is used when you want to define a relationship where multiple instances of one model can be related to multiple instances of another model. For example, a book can be written by multiple authors, and an author can write multiple books.

# Here's how you can create a ManyTo-Many relationship in Django:

# 1. Using ManyToManyField
# The simplest way to define a many-to-many relationship is by using Django's ManyToManyField. This field can be added to either of the related models.

# Example Models
# Let's create two models: Author and Book. Each book can have multiple authors, and each author can write multiple books.

from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)
    published_date = models.DateField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
# In this example, the Book model has a ManyToManyField called authors that references the Author model.

# 2. Creating a Through Model (Intermediate Model)
# Sometimes, you need to add extra fields to the many-to-many relationship. For instance, you might want to keep track of the date an author started writing a particular book. In such cases, you can create an intermediate model to represent the relationship.

# Example with a Through Model

from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    published_date = models.DateField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

class Authorship(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    book = models.ForeignKey(Book, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    contribution_date = models.DateField()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.author.name} - {self.book.title}"

# Update the Book model to use the through model
class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author, through='Authorship')
    published_date = models.DateField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
# In this case, the Authorship model acts as an intermediary that holds additional data about the relationship between Author and Book.

# 3. Using the ManyToMany Relationship in Views
# You can use Django's ORM to manage many-to-many relationships in your views.

# Adding Relationships

# Create authors
author1 = Author.objects.create(name="Author 1", email="author1@example.com")
author2 = Author.objects.create(name="Author 2", email="author2@example.com")

# Create a book
book = Book.objects.create(title="Some Book", published_date="2023-06-24")

# Add authors to the book
book.authors.add(author1, author2)
# Accessing Related Objects
# Get all authors of a book
book = Book.objects.get(id=1)
authors = book.authors.all()

# Get all books of an author
author = Author.objects.get(id=1)
books = author.book_set.all()
# 4. Admin Interface
# To manage these relationships via the Django admin interface, you can use the ManyToManyField as well.

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Author, Book, Authorship

class AuthorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass

class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass

class AuthorshipAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass

admin.site.register(Author, AuthorAdmin)
admin.site.register(Book, BookAdmin)
admin.site.register(Authorship, AuthorshipAdmin)
# Summary
# Direct Many-to-Many: Use ManyToManyField in one of the models.
# Through Model: Use an intermediary model with extra fields and specify it using the through parameter in ManyToManyField.
# This approach allows for a flexible and powerful way to handle complex relationships in Django.
