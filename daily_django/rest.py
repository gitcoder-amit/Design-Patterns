'''REST, which stands for REpresentational State Transfer, is a set of guidelines for designing web services. It  defines how data should be exchanged between different applications on the web. Here's a breakdown of the key terms:

Representational: Information on the web is represented in resources. These resources can be anything from a document to an image or even an entire database. They are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), which are essentially web addresses.
State: In REST, the server doesn't need to remember anything about the client's past interactions (like a shopping cart on a website). Each request from the client is treated independently. This makes RESTful systems simpler and more scalable.
Transfer: Data is transferred between client and server using standard HTTP methods. These methods act like verbs telling the server what to do with the resource. Common methods include:
GET: Retrieves information from a resource. (Imagine browsing a product page)
POST: Creates a new resource. (Think submitting a form)
PUT: Updates an existing resource. (Like editing a profile)
DELETE: Removes a resource. (Deleting an item from your cart)
By following these principles, REST promotes a standardized way for applications to communicate and exchange data efficiently on the web.'''
