before_action :check_daily_limit, only: [:show]

def check_daily_limit
  if current_user.daily_read_count >= DAILY_READ_LIMIT
    render json: { error: "Daily read limit reached" }, status: :forbidden
  else
    current_user.increment!(:daily_read_count)
  end
end
Sidekiq Worker:

ruby
Copy code
class ResetDailyReadCountWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform
    User.update_all(daily_read_count: 0)
  end
end
Cron Job Configuration (using whenever gem):

ruby
Copy code
every :day, at: 'midnight' do
  runner "ResetDailyReadCountWorker.perform_async"
end
4. Challenges and Solutions
Handling Large User Base:

"One challenge was efficiently resetting the read counts for a large number of users. I addressed this by using Sidekiq's background processing capabilities to ensure the operation didn’t impact the app’s performance."
Ensuring Accurate Count:
