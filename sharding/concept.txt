1. Single Server with Multiple Shards:
Advantages:
Simplifies the setup and reduces operational overhead.
Useful for small-scale applications where the load can be handled by a single server.
Disadvantages:
Limited scalability and fault tolerance.
A single point of failure; if the server goes down, all shards become unavailable.
2. Multiple Servers with Multiple Shards:
Advantages:
Distributes the load across multiple servers, improving performance and scalability.
Increases fault tolerance as failure of one server does not affect other shards.
Disadvantages:
More complex to set up and manage.
Higher operational cost due to multiple servers.
3. Combination of Primary and Replica Servers:
Advantages:
Combines load distribution with high availability.
Each shard has a primary server for writes and one or more replicas for reads and backups.
Disadvantages:
Requires setting up and managing replication.
Higher cost and complexity.
Scenarios and Implementations
Scenario 1: Single Server with Multiple Shards
Use Case: Small-scale application with manageable load.

Implementation:

plaintext
Copy code
Server 1:
  - Shard 1: Data range 1-1000
  - Shard 2: Data range 1001-2000
  - Shard 3: Data range 2001-3000
Query Example:

python
Copy code
def get_shard(user_id):
    if 1 <= user_id <= 1000:
        return "shard1"
    elif 1001 <= user_id <= 2000:
        return "shard2"
    elif 2001 <= user_id <= 3000:
        return "shard3"
    return None

# Example usage
user_id = 1500
shard = get_shard(user_id)
print(f"User {user_id} is in {shard}")
Scenario 2: Multiple Servers with Multiple Shards
Use Case: Medium to large-scale application requiring better load distribution and fault tolerance.

Implementation:

plaintext
Copy code
Server 1:
  - Shard 1: Data range 1-1000

Server 2:
  - Shard 2: Data range 1001-2000

Server 3:
  - Shard 3: Data range 2001-3000
Query Example:

python
Copy code
def get_server_for_shard(user_id):
    if 1 <= user_id <= 1000:
        return "server1"
    elif 1001 <= user_id <= 2000:
        return "server2"
    elif 2001 <= user_id <= 3000:
        return "server3"
    return None

# Example usage
user_id = 1500
server = get_server_for_shard(user_id)
print(f"User {user_id} data is on {server}")
Scenario 3: Primary and Replica Servers for Each Shard
Use Case: Large-scale application with high availability and fault tolerance requirements.

Implementation:

plaintext
Copy code
Server 1 (Primary):
  - Shard 1: Data range 1-1000

Server 4 (Replica):
  - Shard 1: Data range 1-1000

Server 2 (Primary):
  - Shard 2: Data range 1001-2000

Server 5 (Replica):
  - Shard 2: Data range 1001-2000

Server 3 (Primary):
  - Shard 3: Data range 2001-3000

Server 6 (Replica):
  - Shard 3: Data range 2001-3000
Query Example:

python
Copy code
def get_server_for_shard(user_id, read=False):
    shard_mapping = {
        1: {"primary": "server1", "replica": "server4"},
        2: {"primary": "server2", "replica": "server5"},
        3: {"primary": "server3", "replica": "server6"},
    }
    shard_id = (user_id - 1) // 1000 + 1
    server_type = "replica" if read else "primary"
    return shard_mapping[shard_id][server_type]

# Example usage
user_id = 1500
write_server = get_server_for_shard(user_id)
read_server = get_server_for_shard(user_id, read=True)

print(f"Write Server for User {user_id}: {write_server}")
print(f"Read Server for User {user_id}: {read_server}")
Summary
Single Server with Multiple Shards is suitable for small applications but lacks scalability and fault tolerance.
Multiple Servers with Multiple Shards provides better load distribution and fault tolerance, ideal for larger applications.
Primary and Replica Servers combine load distribution with high availability, suitable for large-scale applications with high reliability requirements.
Choose the strategy that best fits your application's scale, performance requirements, and budget.
