Brief Introduction:

"I worked on a Hindu spirituality app that features curated songs and articles. My primary responsibility was to implement the notification feature to enhance user engagement."


2. Types of Notifications Implemented
Simple Notification API:

"I implemented simple notifications using a RESTful API. These notifications were primarily used to inform users about new articles, songs, and updates within the app."
Steps Involved:
Created an endpoint to trigger notifications.
Designed the notification payload to include necessary information like title, message, and a URL to redirect users.
Implemented a service to send these notifications to users based on their preferences and activity.
Email Notification using Rails Action Mailer:

"For email notifications, I utilized Rails Action Mailer to send emails to users regarding new content, upcoming events, and personalized spiritual tips."
Steps Involved:
Set up Action Mailer configurations in the Rails application.
Created mailer views and templates for different types of emails.
Integrated background jobs (using Sidekiq or similar) to handle the asynchronous sending of emails, ensuring timely delivery without affecting the app's performance.
Ensured deliverability by configuring SMTP settings and handling email queues.
Push Notification using Firebase:

"To keep users informed in real-time, I implemented push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)."
Steps Involved:
Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging for the app, including the necessary configurations in both the app (Android/iOS) and the server.
Implemented backend logic to send push notifications using the Firebase API.
Created user segments and topics within Firebase to send targeted notifications based on user behavior and preferences.
Ensured secure handling of Firebase tokens and managed the lifecycle of push notifications.
